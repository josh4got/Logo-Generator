# Logo Generator

## Description

Logo Generator is a command line interface (CLI) application that generates logos based on user input for shape, text, and color. The motivation behind this project was to provide an easy-to-use tool for creating simple logos for personal or professional use. This project solves the problem of having to use complex design software or hire a professional designer to create a logo.

During the development of this project, I learned how to use Node.js to build command line applications, work with third-party libraries like Inquirer, and write tests using Jest.
