# Logo Generator

## Description

Logo Generator is a command line interface (CLI) application that generates logos based on user input. This project was made to provide an easy-to-use tool for creating simple logos for personal or professional use. This project eliminates having to use design software or spend significant periods of time creating a logo.

This project taught me how to use Node.js to build command line applications, work with third-party libraries like Inquirer, and write tests using Jest.
